## Description

The scripts in the custom_scripts directory in this repository can be
exposed as REST API endpoints.  This project describes an example using
the [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/).  This django
project is written for PaaS, specifically Openshift.  But it can be adapted on
any platform that Django runs on.

## Setup
```
cd pyvmomi_restapi
pip install requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate

# Develop/Debug
export DEBUG=on SPHERE_USERNAME='someusername' VSPHERE_PASSWORD='somepassword'
python manage.py runserver
```

### Common Errors

If the CDROM is mounted it, mounting again will unmount it and show status="Failed" and shell_returncode=4.  In this case
repeat the POST to mount it.

```
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/vm-helpers/manage-cdrom/ state=mount vsphere_service=vshpere_service vmname='vmname' iso_path='[datastore] path/some.iso'

    "state": "mount",
    "status": "Failed",

    "vsphere_service": "vshpere_service",
    "vmname": "vmname"
}

```

Other errors will include using an incorrect iso_path or vmname.
